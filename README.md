# Manufacturing Performance Analysis

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes manufacturing performance data, focusing on OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), defect rates, and inventory value to identify improvement opportunities.

## 📊 Dataset
The data includes:
- **Manufacturing Data:** Machine-wise production and defects.
- **OEE Data:** Machine performance, availability, and quality scores.
- **Inventory Data:** Product category, stock, and value.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **PostgreSQL** for data querying
- **Power BI** for dashboard visualization

## ⚙️ Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & EDA:** Done in Python.
2. **SQL Queries:** Used to join tables and calculate performance KPIs.
3. **Power BI Dashboard:** Built interactive visuals for management insights.

## 📈 Dashboard Insights
- OEE improved by ~5% after analysis.
- Top 5 machines caused 80% of total defects.
- Inventory value optimized by identifying slow-moving items.
